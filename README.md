This is the frontend portion of my assignment.

Making use of material-ui, custom useAxios hook and offering a multi panel solution for interacting with backend api.
First panel is for user input and second is meant to display all current messages and their status. This second panel updates in realtime when a message switches from failed to sent. (This portion is set a bit fast on backend and may require quickly switching to see effect).

App does require local backend server to be running and configured for port 7232(believe this is default port set in project.
